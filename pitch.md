# Team Faraday, HackVT 2014 --- homeLab

### Intro

Hi, my name is Tristan, this is Bill, and we are Team Faraday. At work we tackle energy efficiency from a marketing perspective, so we’re excited to have the opportunity to build something that everybody can use. Here’s the problem - as a guy who pays an electric bill, whenever I use an appliance or turn on the lights I do so with at best a vague understanding of how much energy I’m using, and I have no idea if there are better options out there. Getting more energy efficient stuff - like LED lightbulbs or even storm windows - could save me money or it might not be worth it at all. And the only way to know for sure is with a meticulously kept spreadsheet. I hate spreadsheets, and I don’t think I’m the only one. The thing is, without this knowledge, every upgrade I make is a gamble. People deserve better. People deserve homeLab.

### Demo

It gives you a real time connection with your energy use, not just overall, but with the power of smart meters you can see usage for individual outlets and appliances.

We leverage machine learning to create a model of your home energy use. One of the most 	interesting things we can do with this data is anomaly detection. If you leave a window open in January, homeLab will send you an alert. If your dryer starts operating less efficiently, you will get a gentle reminder to check your lint trap. This feature is dope.

It will also automatically suggest efficiency upgrades that would, based on your usage, save you the most money.

All of these are useful, but the killer feature here is the ability to know whether or not a product is saving you money. You can do this by running an experiment. Here’s how it works.

I’m interested in a nest thermostat, but I don’t know if it will be worth it. I’m going to buy one, run an experiment on it, and homeLab will show exactly how much it will save me.

All I have to do is enter the name of the product, how much it costs, and which circuits it will affect.

Now my experiment has started. I need to give it at least seven days to measure the difference in usage and return statistically valid results. Since I’m a developer, I can push this fast-forward button to simulate time travel. Woobwoobwoobwoob.

It has now been one week, and homeLab is showing a significant decrease in energy usage. It does the math for me, and shows how much I will be saving and how long it will take before the upgrade pays for itself. This lets me take steps towards higher efficiency by empowering me with the knowledge of what works and what doesn’t. So I can make my investments, keeping the things that work and returning the things that don’t, so I can always be sure that my upgrades are cutting my energy use and saving me money.

### Conclusion

So that’s it. We’ve designed an app for the energy companies of the future. One that connects people to their power and efficiency in a radically different way.
